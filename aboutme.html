        <p class="aboutme__parapage">Hello there, my name is Damir Chaban! I am 14 year old ukranian. I am a junior Web developer, editor, and a singer.</p>
        <p class="aboutme__parapage">I create Websites, graphic designs, music, videos overall more than 5 years. I always do my best to improve myself and give people the most accurate and high-quality product.</p>
        <h2 class="aboutme__subtitlepage">Web-Development career</h2>
        <p class="aboutme__parapage">It all started in autumn of 2024, when i found out that in the IT school, where i was learning MC-Java previosly, a Frontend group just started.
            I was interested in creating websites, so i agreed to join the group. Throughout the course, i learned HTML, CSS, and Scss. The course still
            goes on, and i am constantly improving my skills. I have already created a few websites, including this portfolio, and i am ready to create
            more websites for people who need them. There were a few breaking points where i wanted to quit, because sometimes the course seemed to be
        extra hard, but i still go on.</p>
        <h2 class="aboutme__subtitlepage">Editing career</h2>
        <p class="aboutme__parapage">This started in 2019. I just learnt about the app CapCut and started doing mini-films there. I was doing good, and even some of my friends,
            who were doing their youtube channels, asked me to edit their videos. That really motivated me, and soon i moved on to a more advanced
            video editors. As of right now, i began my youtube channel, and soom i am going to post videos on there. I mastered the art of editing,
            because i have been doing it with passion for more than 5 years. I can edit videos for you, meeting different requirements: for blog, youtube, etc.
        </p>
        <h2 class="aboutme__subtitlepage">Design career</h2>
        <p class="aboutme__parapage">It isnt really much of a career, i am just really good at it. I mostly use Canva, because its easy to learn there. I have already created a few graphic
            designs for my friend, who is a game developer, and he was satisfied with the result. Not so long ago, i started creating 3D models in Blender, and i am
            still learning it, because its a really hard program to learn. But i am sure that i will master it, because i am really passionate about it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="aboutme__subtitlepage">Music career</h2>
        <p class="aboutme__parapage">I started singing at the age of 7, which was 6 years ago. My parents, and every coach said i had a good vocal skills, and i shouldnt abandon them.
            I won various competitions. Surprisingly, i won the first singing competiton i ever participated in, and it wasnt even the 1st place, it was the Grand Prix.
            I was really happy, and that motivated me to keep going. I am still singing, and i am planning to create my own music with FL Studio, which i am currently learning.
            I already created a few beats, but it is not enough to say i am a professional producer. So i am still practicing.
